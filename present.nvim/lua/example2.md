    - I have a online only resume
    - I have a hand-in/email resume

    - Just saying they would really like to work with me
    - When a spot opens up i'll be first on their list
- Emailed a manager for a non tech job, put out feelers and have a convo
- Updated LinkedIn
    - Still some more to go
        - Like the about section
    - maybe we can review if that would be beneficial

# What do I want this coachign sesison to focus on?

- Maybe to review and get an extra opinion
- Anything else

# What do I need info on? What am I stuck on?

- any tips to help stand out more when filling out an online form?
- should I be more active on sites like linked in? Faking it?
- application pace

# What could we brainstorm on?

- probably won't know upfront until we meet

# What does success look like at the end of this session?

- some new info to help with the next batch of apps
    - first responses for a few should come in this week
- pointing out any missteps or things I could be missing
    - I have always had a good network of friends and former coworkers but it
    seems this tiem around none have any leads for me.
        - the market feels very thin and rough seas
