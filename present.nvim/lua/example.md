# What can you celebrate?

- applied to 16 jobs over the last 3-4wks
    - 4 weren't a great fit
    - 3 were a very good fit
    - 1-2 I could get excited for but probably long shot
    - the rest were just vanilla
- had a very nice time away with family
- worked on thinking through what I really am looking for

# What do I want this coachign sesison to focus on?

- tips or pointers on:
    - considering a pivot
    - my approach towards applying for *THE RIGHT JOB*
- cover online application experience:
    - resume almost doesn't seem to matter
        - must enter everything into their forms anyway
    - all have asked about vet/disab/race/sex 
        - only 2 left these as optional 
        - never had a consideration to say something different but 
          almost feel like I should consider it
- how many applications is a good healthy pace, the inbetween time
    - I am currently studying and working on side projects
    - I have averaged about 4apps/wk
    - I have started to be a lot more picky

# What do I need info on? What am I stuck on?

- any tips to help stand out more when filling out an online form?
- should I be more active on sites like linked in? Faking it?
- application pace

# What does success look like at the end of this session?

- some new info to help with the next batch of apps
    - first responses for a few should come in this week
- pointing out any missteps or things I could be missing
    - I have always had a good network of friends and former coworkers but it
    seems this tiem around none have any leads for me.
        - the market feels very thin and rough seas
